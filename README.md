# 16-Portfolio-2.0
ow that you've built a full-stack web application and have another project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but is still *critical* on your journey as a developer.

## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring projects 1 and 2 and at least four exemplary homework assignments. (https://github.com/EdenKhaos)

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring projects 1 and 2 and four exemplary assignments. (https://github.com/EdenKhaos)

* Submit an updated resume (see link below)

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile (see link below)

## Follow pseudo code in html file (index.html)
I used a free template from w3-schools and their library to create this more uniform portfolio page. This time I only need 1 portfolio page with links 

1. Used initial w3-schools black and white template
2. Created styling within the HTML file
3. Modified side-bar image and portfolio section and portfolio projects
4. Updated about ans skill section
5. Updated reputation section
6. Updated contact section
7. Created new input form to allow others to contact me.
8. Created link to updated resume.
9. Updated footer to link to my current information

## CSS/Style file (typical setup to create changes to font, colors and backgrounds)
1. Biggest modification was to create a hover over image with two link icons per portfolio project image. This was an added function from the original template to allow more fluid links to the repository's and live links per project.
2. The rest of the CSS styling was pretty standard to the page template.
